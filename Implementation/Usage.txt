Usage:
Online-algorithm to automatically draw optimal samples from libraries of 
RNA-seqdata. from the NCBI.
In a stepwise procedure parts of these libraries are downloaded and alligne\n
 to the genome of the species with STAR. At each step the run that is expected to yield the most increase in coverage, is chosen. 
Input:
    - Genome of the target species
    - Runlist named "Runlist.txt".
